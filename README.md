# SortingVisualizer

This visualizer tends to show the process through which the data goes before getting sorted. Try playing with the number of data 
and time taken for each iteration here(https://deepakandgupta.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/). There are many Sorting algorithms to explore and they all follow different steps to sort data. 
Algorithms implemented Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort.

The code is written in native javascript and to provide the functionality of time, setInterval(used in place of a for loop) and 
setTimeout are used which are asynchronous and thus do not block the code while running. For information about this and event loop,
